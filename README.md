# Monoalphabetic-Substitution-Cipher-Script-in-Bash
The monoalphabetic substitution cipher replaces each letter in the plaintext with a corresponding letter from a substitution key. The key is a permutation of the alphabet, where each letter maps uniquely to another letter. For example, if the key maps "A" to "Q", "B" to "W", and so on, the plaintext "HELLO" might be encrypted as "ITSSG".
